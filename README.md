# Backend Hexa Template

My backend template for Hexagonal Architecture not perfect at all, but it's good enough for starting.

Ref: https://netflixtechblog.com/ready-for-changes-with-hexagonal-architecture-b315ec967749

## Minus

- CMD usage
- GRPC
- Worker
- Prometheus metrics
- Jaeger tracing
- Integration Testing

Will be updated soon.
